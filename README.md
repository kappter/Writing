# Ideas Turned to Words

No matter the industry, writing is a skill that _will_ make a difference. The challenge for so many is to take what is in the mind and turn it into pros; often when there are only non-concrete concepts or nebulous ideas. 

## Brainstorming
Many of us can recall a time when a brainstorming session was effective and another when it was a waste of time. We are therefor most likely aware of the goal of any [brainstorming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming) activity; which is simply __to attempt to find a solution to a problem as a group or individual by collecting poor and superb approaches while embracing random or seemingly unrelated concepts in the approach__. 

### Mind Mapping

One of the most popular and productive methods is __mind mapping__. Traditionally done on paper, digital mind mapping tools are available for smart phones, tablets, desktops, and even with any web browser.

Mind maps are generally formed by placing a central idea in the middle of a page or blank digital project and branch out with categories or hierarchal information with lines linking ideas or concepts. The goal is to not be afraid of ideas that seem unrelated or even to employ some random or outside influence to aid in the activity. [Learning How to Learn](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/psychology/developmental-psychology/learning-how-learn) by Joseph Novak discusses this in great detail. 

__TRY IT!__: 

1. Grab a sheet of paper and write a word in the middle (emphasize it be size, color or weight).
2. Write hight level words around it that logically connect directly to the main subject.
3. Do the same for each node until you realize your topics are no longer related at all. 
- VARIATION: use magnetic poetry or a random idea generator to produce ideas only to see if a relationship exists and follow it out as far as possible.
- VARIATION: Try the exercise 1: without a reference or 2: with an exhaustive reference.

### Concept Maps

Another form of mapping employs most of what mind maps entail while adding proposition or linking statements between hierarchal or otherwise connected ideas. Phrases such as, "depends on," "can be," "made of," or "from." 

### Freewriting
[Freewriting](http://www.wikihow.com/Freewrite) is the act of writing for a pre-determined amount of time on paper or computer without lifting hands from the device written on. 

__TRY IT!__: use the following strategies for visual project:

- Write for 10–15 minutes about the problem or the subject in a more general way (for instance, why you chose this topic, what it is about)
- Write for 10 minutes about everything related to the subject or problem
- Write down three words important to the subject or problem and then write for 10–15 minutes about those three words
- Midway through a project, write down what you have done in terms of concept development and idea searching, and what more could be done
- Pose a specific question about the project and answer it

### Looping
An extension of freewriting used to direct the freewrite back to itself. The point is NOT to worry about grammar while extending out as far as possible with a topic or problem and bringing it back to near relevance. 

__TRY IT!__: 

1. Perform a freewrite as normal
2. Reread the creation and circle the most interesting or provocative thoughts to develop (1-5 suffice, keep is short.) 3. Take each topic and write it in reverse to original topic while being as spontaneous and detailed as possible for a prescribed period of time.
