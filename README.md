# Ideas Turned to Words

No matter the industry, writing is a skill that _will_ make a difference. The challenge for so many is to take what is in the mind and turn it into pros; often when there are only non-concrete concepts or nebulous ideas. 

## Brainstorming
Many of us can recall a time when a brainstorming session was effective and another when it was a waste of time. We are therefor most likely aware of the goal of any [brainstorming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming) activity; which is simply __to attempt to find a solution to a problem as a group or individual by collecting poor and superb approaches while embracing random or seemingly unrelated concepts in the approach__. 

### Mind Mapping

One of the most popular and productive methods is __mind mapping__. Traditionally done on paper, digital mind mapping tools are available for smart phones, tablets, desktops, and even with any web browser.

Mind maps are generally formed by placing a central idea in the middle of a page or blank digital project and branch out with categories or hierarchal information with lines linking ideas or concepts. The goal is to not be afraid of ideas that seem unrelated or even to employ some random or outside influence to aid in the activity. [Learning How to Learn](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/psychology/developmental-psychology/learning-how-learn) by Joseph Novak discusses this in great detail. 

### Concept Maps
Another form of mapping employs most of what mind maps entail while adding proposition or linking statements between hierarchal ideas. Phrases such as, "depends on," "can be," "made of," or "from."
